00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:04,958
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  Hey, I'm out at a ravine. What's this thing that spans across it?

2
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:07,793
Speaker SPEAKER_02:  That is how you get to my sector.

3
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:10,308
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  No kidding. Well, let me hike over.

4
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:15,050
Speaker SPEAKER_02:  Well, it's locked up in mainly four emergencies. I've never actually used it.

5
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:17,564
Speaker SPEAKER_02:  Rangers use it from time to time, but that's it.

6
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,711
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Help! Oh God, it's an emergency!

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,263
Speaker SPEAKER_02:  Oh, really?

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,191
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I got eyes on a tornado. I gotta get out of here.

9
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:31,992
Speaker SPEAKER_03:  A tornado in the heart of the Rockies?

10
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,292
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Yes!

11
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:53,272
Speaker SPEAKER_03:  Holy moly, I need to call this in! Tom, Two Forks sees a tornado! He says he needs an evac into my sector. It's a meteorological impossibility? There haven't been tornadoes in the Greater Yellowstone Region in a hundred million years? You're gonna need him to stay and take a detailed personal account, even if it means giving his life? Okay, I'll tell him.

12
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:55,600
Speaker SPEAKER_03:  Sorry, Hank. No dice.

13
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:57,423
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  Man.
